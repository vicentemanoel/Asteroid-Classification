# Asteroid-Classification
This project develops an automated classifier to identify asteroids trapped in the 4J-2S-1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter and Saturn, using proper orbital elements from the AstDyS catalog. It offers a fast, scalable machine learning solution to estimate resonance likelihood, bypassing computationally intensive numerical simulations.
